Double click the new icon in the desktop, or single-click the new icon in the start menu, and the software will open.

#####SETTING UP#####

To use this application, the pre-requisites are:
1. First computer's IP Address - The application configures the user's IP address on its own.
2. A free port in the first computer - The application uses the default port 80. In case it is busy, A message is shown, in which case, the port number is to be changed.
3. Second computer's IP Address - The user is required to add the IP address of the computer with which he is to chat. In case the computer is offline, a message is shown.
4. A free port in the second computer - The application uses the default port 80. In case it is busy, A message is shown, in which case, the port number is to be changed.

####USING THE SOFTWARE####

Once all pre-requisites are complete, press "Connect". If the connection is successful, the text changes to "Connected", and the button is disabled. This means that the user can chat now. To ensure privacy of LAN users, a 2-way connection has to be made for chatting, which means, that while the user at one end has to connect with the user at other end, the user at the other end also has to connect to the current user, only then can the chat progress.

Enter the message you wish to send in the textbox beside the "Send" Button. Pressing "Enter" Key, or clicking the "Send" Button will trigger the message to be sent. The message will appear in the textbox above the "Send" Button.

If an IP address is to be remembered for future chats, the user may click on the "Add Contacts" button which will open a new dialog. The user may save as many contacts as required, and then close the window to save the contacts.

To add the IP and port values from the saved contact, click the "Existing Contacts" button, either 1) Double-click on a contact-name, or 2) Select a contact name and click "Select" button at the bottom of the dialog, or 3)Select a contact name, and close the dialog. This will load the saved IP address and the port number into their respective text-boxes.

To delete a contact from the existing list of contacts, click the "Existing Contacts" button. Then select the contact which is to be deleted, and press the "Delete" key. This will successfully delete a contact from the list of contacts.

To chat with another person, click on the "Open A New Chat" link. That will open a new window, in which a new connection can be made. However, if multiple chat windows are open simultaneously, make sure the port numbers in the "You" section are all different.

To close a chat connection, or stop chatting, simply close the window, by clicking the close button, or pressing Alt+F4 in the keyboard.

####ADVANCED FEATURES####

All the chat contacts of the user are saved in the settings.xml file (Present in "AppData/LANChat"), so that contacts can be easily imported/exported according to the users needs. If contacts are required in a new system, simply install the software there, and replace its settings.xml with the required settings.xml, and the contacts will bw imported.
